The proposed project is a web based system in where a user can  report or add  posts to the website describing problems of their area regarding damaged infrastructures, water supply etc . 
        The aim of the project is to gain attention of the people who have the power and authority to solve these problems eg. Politicians, officers, NGO workers.

The Users can posts photos of the issues and caption it on the posts and can also view the issues of their locality.
        
This project is created by me and my classmate for our BSc final year project. We used node.js runtime and express.js framework for our server side programming . Also we used mongoDB as our database and mongoose ODM . We used handlebars template engine . We haven't used bootstrap or any other front end library/ framework .
