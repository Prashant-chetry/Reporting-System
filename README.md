This project is created by me and my classmate for our BSc final year project. We used node.js runtime and express.js framework for our server side programming . Also we used mongoDB as our database and mongoose ODM . We used handlebars template engine . We haven't used bootstrap or any other front end library/ framework .


How To Run it:
        *step 1: install nodejs environment.
        *step 2: Install Mongodb server.
        *step 3: Go inside the Folder (i.e Reporting-System) and then run 'npm install' in terminal. This will install all the modules required to run the server.
        *step 4: Run the server by typing 'node server.js' in terminal.
